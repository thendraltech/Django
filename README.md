```A backend framework.

Instead of programming servers from scratch, we use Django.

Django has nothing to do with the look and feel of your website.

It is open source , the source code is publicly available on GitHub.

It is free to use you can use it to build commercial applications.
```

### Client server architecture.
``` A website/ web application resides on a server.

To access a website, we make a URL request from our browser (client) to the server.

The server needs to be able to handle incoming URL request and return some appropriate response.

This response might be some plain simple data, or it might be an entire webpage.

This webpage is then returned to the client( browser).
```

### Why are we learning Django ?
``` It allows us to build any kind of scalable and complex web application from scratch which could be accessed by thousands of people.

We will be building a buy & sell marketplace website in this course which includes features like authentication and payment gateway.

We will also deploy this website on an actual server.
